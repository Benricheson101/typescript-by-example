description: Extended types in TypeScript
---
Similarly to with classes, TypeScript allows you to extend interfaces with the `extends` keyword.
\
\
Extended types have all properties of the parent class and any new properties declared.
\
\
By using the `extends` keyword in a [generic](/generics) type declaration, you can match any child of a parent type.
